# The Elusive Bomb Evasion Squad

This was my first serious programing project and also my High School senior project. I was a completely self-taught C/C++ developer at that time.
My deepest desire at the time was to eventually become an actual software developer.

This is essentually just a hardcoded arcade game that is built off of [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). It's not quite finished, but it at the very least
is playable. 

Upon execution, the menus allows a game to be started.

After that the game has stated, the player will spawn and smiley faces will fall from the sky. The objective is to collect as many points as possible
while also avoiding the smiley faces. Some smiley faces will fall straight down and others will home in on the player's location.

Then when the player finally has hit too many smiley faces, an ending screen will appear.

# Execution

The executable for the project and all of its dependencies are in this repository. Although, this was all built on Windows and is still working on Windows 10.
